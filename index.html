      The issue with calling react from CDN links is it is time consuming and also whenever a new raect version comes we have to change the links here. So, the best practise is to install react from npm and use react when it is installed as a dependency
      npm install react and npm install react-dom

      <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script> -->

    <!-- <script src="App.js"></script>  This will give error as Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports. because this import is not normal JS, so we have to tell browser that this is module.  -->
